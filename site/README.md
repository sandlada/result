# Documentation site

The published documentation for `@sandlada/result` lives at <https://result.sandlada.com>. It is an
[Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) project in this directory, kept out of the library
build on purpose: `../tsconfig.json`, `../rolldown.config.ts` and `../vitest.config.ts` all scope
themselves to `../src`, so nothing here can leak into the published package.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server. The narrative pages sync through the Astro lifecycle. |
| `npm run build` | Build to `dist/`. Runs the narrative sync, TypeDoc generation, link validation and `verify:seo`. |
| `npm run check` | `astro check` — type-checks `.astro` files and page frontmatter. |
| `npm run check:snippets` | Type-checks the examples in `src/snippets/` against `../src`. Requires no library build. |
| `npm run verify` | Full local verification: `check:snippets`, then `check`, then `build`. |
| `npm run verify:seo` | Checks the built pages for the search-metadata invariants (titles, descriptions, canonicals, JSON-LD, indexability, sitemap). Also runs as part of `npm run build`; can re-check an existing `dist/` on its own. |
| `npm run sync` | Copies the narrative pages into the content tree. Rarely needed directly — every Astro entry point (`dev`/`build`/`check`/`sync`) runs it automatically. Accepts `--force` to adopt hand-written files. |
| `npm run generate:icons` | Renders `public/og.png` and `public/apple-touch-icon.png` from their SVG sources. Only needed after editing those sources. |
| `npm run version:new -- <slug> [label]` | Archives the current documentation as a new version. |

### Call order

Scripts form a chain — run them in this order, or let the aggregate commands do it:

```text
npm run verify
 └─ 1. check:snippets   (fastest: type-checks src/snippets/ against ../src)
 └─ 2. check            (astro check: .astro files and page frontmatter)
 └─ 3. build
      └─ 3a. astro build     (content sync → TypeDoc → link validation → static pages)
      └─ 3b. verify:seo      (checks dist/ metadata invariants)
```

Notes:

- `check:snippets` runs first because it is the fastest gate; `build` runs last
  because it is the slowest and depends on everything else being clean.
- `verify:seo` needs no separate invocation inside `build`, but it can re-check an
  existing `dist/` on its own without rebuilding.
- `dev` needs no preparation: the content sync runs inside the Astro lifecycle.
  `preview` serves an existing `dist/`, so it follows `build`.
- `sync` is automatic; run it manually only to refresh content while the dev
  server is already running.
- `generate:icons` is independent of the chain — run it only after editing
  `assets/og.svg` or `public/favicon.svg`.
- `version:new` runs a full `build` internally, so run `npm run verify` first and
  keep the working tree clean before archiving.

## How the content is produced

`lib/site.mjs` is the single source of truth for shared site data: the site
constants, the published module registry (in the same order as the module map in
the repository's `AGENTS.md`), the TypeDoc `entryPoints` derived from it, the
curated `apiPages` search metadata, and the repository paths. The sidebar, the
content sync, the API metadata plugin and the SEO verification all read from it,
so adding a subpath means adding one registry entry. The sync additionally
checks the registry against the `exports` map of the root `package.json` and
fails when the two disagree.

- **API reference** — `starlight-typedoc` runs TypeDoc over the entry points from
  `lib/site.mjs`, one per published subpath export, and writes `src/content/docs/api/`.
  That directory is generated, so it is gitignored. `entryFileName` is `index` so that `/api/`
  lists every module.

  The plugin also ships a `typeDocSidebarGroup`, but it is not used here. It fills its group by
  turning each kind group ("Functions", "Interfaces", …) into an `autogenerate` entry over a
  directory that only exists in the default per-member file layout; with
  `outputFileStrategy: 'modules'` a module is a single page, so that group comes out empty and
  the module labels end up as groups with no links. The sidebar group is built from the same
  `entryPoints` list instead, one link per module, which keeps it in step with generation and
  lets the link validator check every entry.
- **Behavior modes** — the `sync-content` Starlight plugin (first in the
  `plugins` array of `astro.config.mjs`) copies `../docs/behavior-modes.md` into
  `src/content/docs/behavior-modes.md` during `config:setup`, so every Astro
  entry point (`dev`/`build`/`check`/`sync`) sees fresh content with no explicit
  step. The repository file stays the single source of truth; the copy is
  gitignored and rewritten, so it cannot drift. Links that point at repository
  files are rewritten to GitHub URLs, except inside fenced code blocks.
- **Module specs** — the same sync copies every `../src/<module>/README.md` into
  `src/content/docs/specs/<module>.md`. The module list and the per-page search
  descriptions come from the registry in `lib/site.mjs`, shared with the sidebar
  so the two cannot drift; a module without a description fails the sync.
  Repository links are resolved against the source file: sibling specs and
  `behavior-modes` stay internal, everything else points at GitHub. The
  implementation lives in `lib/sync-content.mjs` (import-safe, also runnable via
  `npm run sync`); generated pages carry a marker, unchanged files are left
  untouched, and stale pages owned by the sync are pruned.
- **Hand-written pages** — `src/content/docs/*.md` are edited directly. A synced
  target that exists without the generated marker is never overwritten (the sync
  fails instead) unless `npm run sync -- --force` is passed.
- **API search metadata** — `plugins/seo-api-pages.mjs` runs after `starlight-typedoc` in the
  Starlight `plugins` array and replaces the `title` and `description` frontmatter of every
  generated API page with the curated values from `lib/site.mjs`. The generated pages only
  carry the bare module name and no description, so without this step every API page would fall
  back to the site-wide description. A generated page that is missing from the registry fails the
  build; a registry entry that no longer matches a generated page fails `verify:seo`. Frontmatter
  parsing is shared with the sync through `lib/frontmatter.mjs`.

`sanitizeComments` is enabled for TypeDoc because JSDoc prose such as `Promise<boolean>` is not
valid MDX, and `starlight-versions` parses every page with `remark-mdx` when it archives a version.

TypeDoc pins each "Defined in" reference to the commit it was built from. GitHub can only serve a
commit once it reaches the remote, so `lib/source-revision.mjs` falls back to the default branch while the
current commit is still local. An already pushed revision is used verbatim, which is what makes an
archived version point at the code it shipped with.

## Styling

`src/styles/custom.css` mirrors Starlight's CSS custom properties — colors, typography, layout,
shadows and z-index — and is registered through the `customCss` option in `astro.config.mjs`.
It starts out identical to the stock theme, so editing a value is what changes the appearance;
deleting a declaration falls back to the Starlight default, while keeping it freezes that value
against Starlight upgrades. The stylesheet is global and unlayered, so it applies to the archived
versions and to the generated API pages as well.

## Versions

Archived versions live in `src/content/docs/<slug>/` and are committed. `versions.json` lists them
and drives the version selector; the newest entry is the most recent release.

```bash
npm run version:new -- 0.20260811        # slug only, label defaults to v0.20260811
npm run version:new -- 0.20260811 v0.20260811
git add src/content/docs/0.20260811 src/content/versions src/versions.json
```

The script refuses to run when the slug is already configured or its directory already exists, and
it verifies afterwards that an API reference was archived. A build or verification failure
restores `versions.json` and removes the archive directories created along the way, leaving the
working tree as it was found. Archiving is performed by
`starlight-versions` during the build, which is why the script always builds.

Unlike the current version, an archive keeps its own copy of `src/content/docs/api/`. The API
reference of a published version therefore stays frozen even as the library evolves.

Archived versions stay reachable for readers, but they are kept out of the index: the route
middleware marks every page under a `versions.json` slug as `noindex`, and the sitemap integration
filters those URLs out. Both read `versions.json`, so a newly archived version is covered
automatically.

## Search metadata

Every page needs metadata that page frontmatter cannot provide, so it is split across three places:

- **`astro.config.mjs`** adds the tags every page shares: `og:image` (the committed
  `public/og.png`), the Twitter image, the theme color, the apple touch icon, and the
  `google-site-verification` / `msvalidate.01` tags when `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` /
  `BING_SITE_VERIFICATION` are set in the build environment. The raw robots policy is not set
  here.
- **`src/starlightRouteData.ts`** is Starlight route middleware (registered through the
  `routeMiddleware` config key; the file must not be called `src/middleware.ts`, a path Starlight
  rejects because Astro reserves it). It sets the `robots` policy for every page — `noindex` for
  archived versions and the 404 page, `index, follow, max-image-preview:large` everywhere else —
  switches the home page to `og:type: website`, and injects the JSON-LD blocks (`WebSite` and
  `SoftwareSourceCode` on the home page, `TechArticle` plus `BreadcrumbList` elsewhere).
- **`lib/site.mjs`** holds the site constants, the module registry, the derived
  TypeDoc entry points and the curated titles and descriptions of the generated
  API pages; see "How the content is produced".

`public/robots.txt` points crawlers at `sitemap-index.xml`. `scripts/verify-seo.mjs` runs as part
of `npm run build` and fails when a page loses its title, description, canonical, social image,
JSON-LD, robots policy, or when the sitemap and the built pages disagree. Editing `assets/og.svg`
or `public/favicon.svg` requires `npm run generate:icons` so the committed PNGs match.

## Deployment

The site is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker that serves static assets. `wrangler.jsonc` in this
directory defines it: the Worker has no script, it uploads `dist/` and serves the generated
`404.html` for unknown paths. Cloudflare builds the project through Workers Builds, which is what
the dashboard offers when a repository is connected; there is no deployment job in
`.github/workflows`, where `docs.yml` only verifies the build.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Project name | `result` (must match `name` in `wrangler.jsonc`) |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `cd site && npm ci && npm run build` |
| Deploy command | `cd site && npx wrangler deploy` |
| Environment variable | `NODE_VERSION=26` (Astro requires Node >= 22.12) |
| Custom domain | `result.sandlada.com` |

The `cd site` prefix in both commands keeps them independent of any root-directory setting. If the
project is instead configured with `site` as its root directory, drop the prefix.

`npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config site/wrangler.jsonc` validates the configuration locally
without authenticating, including that the assets directory resolves.

`.node-version` pins the same Node version inside the build root, so the version travels with the
repository even if the environment variable is ever missing.

Cloudflare checks out the whole repository, so TypeDoc can read `../src` and `../tsconfig.json`
even though the build runs inside `site/`.

Workers Builds rebuilds on every change in the repository; unlike Pages it has no build watch
paths, so unrelated commits also trigger a build.

Do not add a version to `versions.json` without running `npm run version:new`, because the next
build would then create the archive itself and the deployed site would describe a version that is
not in the repository. The `Verify the build left the working tree clean` step in `docs.yml` fails
in that situation.
